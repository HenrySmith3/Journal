A simple journaling program in python

Fairly straightforward, I had seen the idea on reddit to keep a journal and liked it, so I decided to start keeping one. I wanted to have organized files with timestamps and everything, so I wrote a quick python program to keep track of this for me. I hope to make a full reader for the log files and have extra features, but it works well for what it does now.
The point of keeping a journal is really just to keep me on track with what I want to be doing. People tend to be bad at balancing short term wants and long term goals, and so by forcing myself to write out what I'm doing and what I want to accomplish, I keep myself from falling into the trap of not doing anything really productive.
